## Installation

### Download Binary From Github
For every new release a Github workflow will build a binary in Github servers and will upload it as a release asset in Github releases.

You can find the latest Github release [here](https://github.com/zer0-x/ianny/releases/latest) or the releases page [here](https://github.com/zer0-x/ianny/releases).

## Build

> **Note**
> You need to have [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/), [`meson`](https://mesonbuild.com/) and [`libdbus-1-dev`](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/) installed in you system.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/zer0-x/ianny.git

cd ianny

# Checkout to a release tag e.g. v1.0.1
git checkout vx.x.x

meson build
meson compile -C build
```

You will find the binary in `./build/src/ianny`

To install:
```shell
meson install -C build
```

# Usage

You just need to execute the binary eather direcrly or by enabling it to auto-start with your desktop environment's settings, since it provides a `.desktop` file for auto-start.

# Config

The defaults might not fit your needs, so you can change them via a config file.

The config file is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/io.github.zer0_x.ianny/config.toml` or by default `~/.config/io.github.zer0_x.ianny/config.toml`. Just create it and specify the options you need with the [toml format](https://toml.io/):

```toml
idle_timeout = 7
short_break_timeout = 20
long_break_timeout = 64
short_break_duration = 2
long_break_duration = 7
```

> **Note**
> Time specified in minutes
